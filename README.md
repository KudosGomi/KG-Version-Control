# Version Control Desktop App for Digital Projects ðŸ—ƒðŸ—‚

A version control program that works for a Mac or Windows operating system that can create a workspace for any computer project and makes it easy to save a directory within the user's local machine, copy any folder or file to the workspace or any other directory, and organizes incremental development of a project with branches that help with experimenting with the master project branch that keeps track of merges, all through the convince of the command line of a computer. The program also provides password protection for the backup directories, projects, and project branches.
