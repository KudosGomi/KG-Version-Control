# Backup Workspace with Version Control üóÉüîê

(STILL IN PROGRESS)
<br />
Software Developmet Life Cycle: AGILE
<br />
Development Start Date: 

Learning from the project:
  * Java preferences in order to save/delete directories, passwords, the depth the KGVC program can access or create new folders/paths, etc.
  * Developing for all common operating systems
  * Processes to execute the copying/saving files and directories
  * Java APIs: File, Files, Path, spilt, Preferences, 
  * Multiple classes & objects
  * After completed, I want to create another version where the names of variables, methods, and classes are abbreviated or encoded.

Goals for the project:
 * The start of an OS assistant program that can group together and execute single OS terminal/command prompt commands....
 * 
  
Synopsis of the program:

  The KG Version Control (KGVC) program is intended to serve as a secured backup workspace for all digital computer projects, folders, or files. The workspace provides a certain imposed folder in which the KGVC program needs in order to backup, copy, and save files or directories too. The workspace is choosen by the user and must already exist because the KGVC program terminates without a workspace nor can it create folders to bypass the imposed workspace that the KGVC program needs to work with. Once a user's imposed workspace directory is entered and validated, the KGVC program then provides version control features to the workspace. The KGVC program is equipped with many different system preferences and allows the user to make the KGVC program more secured, such as 1. password protecting commands, projects, or branches; 2. allowing the KGVC to create projects and/or branches only; 3. the depth the KGVC program has permission to access and organize files; and etc. This workspace can then be easily used to track what the KGVC program is doing. The workspace can also make it easy to transfer everything from what the user wants to backup to the workspace to another storage device.
